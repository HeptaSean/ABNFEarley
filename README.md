# _abnfearley_ – An Earley parser for ABNF grammars in Python
_abnfearley_ is a parser for Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) grammars.
It uses an adaption of the techniques given in Jay Earley's 1970
paper “An Efficient Context-Free Parsing Algorithm”
[[doi:10.1145/362007.362035]](https://doi.org/10.1145/362007.362035).
It can handle ABNF grammars as specified in [RFC 5234
“Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications:
ABNF”](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc5234) and updated in [RFC 7405
“Case-Sensitive String Support in
ABNF”](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7405).

## Installation
TODO: Upload to PyPI and give installation instructions.

## Basic Usage
TODO: Give an example with a small toy grammar (loaded from a file) in an
interactive python session.

TODO: Create a demonstration script, which gets an ABNF grammar file and
a target file and shows the resulting abstract syntax graph or gives
meaningful errors.
